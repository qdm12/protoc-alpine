## Usage

### Copy it in your Alpine image

This is most useful for CI setup where you want protoc to generate your files.

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.12
# Copy the binary
COPY --from=qmcgaw/protoc /usr/local/bin/protoc /usr/local/bin/protoc
# Copy the include proto files
COPY --from=qmcgaw/protoc /usr/local/lib/google /usr/local/lib/google
# ... (your other instructions)
```

### Use the image directly

```sh
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/workspace -w /workspace qmcgaw/protoc
```

‚ö†Ô∏è To avoid permission issues, the image runs as `root` by default.

### Extend the image

```Dockerfile
FROM qmcgaw/protoc
# Place your instructions below
```
